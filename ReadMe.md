# port-forwarder 

A simple TCP port forwarder built in Go. It redirects traffic from a source port to a target port, making local services accessible over a network.

## Features
- Port forwarding between any two TCP ports
- Automatic target port selection if not provided
- Displays available network interfaces for easier LAN access
- Lightweight and fast using Goâ€™s concurrency

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bethel-nz/Ech.0.git
   cd Ech.0
   ```
2. Build the executable:
   ```sh
   go build -o echo main.go
   ```
3. Run the forwarder:
   ```sh
   ./echo -source localhost:3000 -target :8080
   ```

## Usage
Basic port forwarding:
```sh
./port-forwarder -source localhost:3000 -target :8080
```
Automatically find an available port:
```sh
./port-forwarder -source localhost:3000
```
Access over LAN by using your local IP:
```sh
http://192.168.x.x:8080
```

## Development
Run in debug mode:
```sh
go run main.go -source localhost:3000 -target :8080
```


## Why
- Needed a way to access services running on my pc over the LAN network
